🎯 Real-Time Object Detection & Tracking System

A real-time computer vision application that detects and tracks objects in live video streams using deep learning models and tracking algorithms.
The system processes each video frame, identifies objects, assigns tracking IDs, and displays results with bounding boxes in real time.
